# Gaki_No_Laughing_Auto_Play
Because I love Gaki but don't love moving about just to click a link.

Basically it's a python program that will continue run the chosen playlist until stopped.  All of the links come directly from the subreddit.  The playlists are all hardcoded but are left simple enough that everyone can make their own and enjoy.  
If you decide to go the "Import" route in IDLE, you can skip around in episodes.  Eventually I'll add that functionality in the currently very limited UI, but until then, I hope you all enjoy.  

Instructions:
Should be able to double click and run it from jump if you have python.  Otherwise, download python (v3.*).  If still not consult Google.  He/She/It/They/Them is much wiser than I.
Kanpai.
